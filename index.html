        <p>Hi, Pookie I will cut to the chase me and Yashu got broke up and not because lack of understanding and stuff but because of caste differences by her side 
            or maybe she don,t like me but I don't care. and it happened really long ago.
            Yrr u know maybe or maybe not when we were used to talk 24*7 I didn't realised  that I was falling in love with you deep and deep everyday I always ignored it as mey be she is my best bff 
            that's why it could be happening but I was dead wrong yrr. Cause I don't zoneout watching any girl but I always do when it's you
            Your silly behaviour, care for me and everyone, and scolding me when I do something wrong just attracts me sooo sooooo much to you
            And I also know u want to ignore me for ur NEET and becoming a Doctor ohh w8 sorry not just any Doctor the best Psychologist this world can have.
            Soo, That's why I am not writing this letter to the Present Day Krishu, I am writing this to the Krishu  who has cracked her NEET and going to a perfect Doctor.
            But I am expecting the answer of Future Krishu from Present Day Krishu. I hope I will get an answer. 
            And hnn I can w8 for years for you cause u r the only one who knows the real me and u r the only one whom I feel  comfortable with.
            Seriously saying I was mad cause kbhi Yashi ke saath bhi comfort wali feeling ni aayi. But tumhare saath humesha aati hai.

            Vaise hnn I know you have a crush too toh mere chances 0.1% hai but kmse kam 0.1% toh hai ki u will say YES.
            And seriously saying if you then want we will not talk till your entrance get cleared.
           (And I will not disturb you in your studies. I will not even talk to you. I will not even look at you. I will not even think about you.) Yeh AI kitna cringe hai yrr ðŸ˜‚
          
           Hmm well carrying on seriously mai itna bda overthinker hu ki maine sochlia ki Adi and tumhare beech kuch hai (I hate Myself for that sorry, usko mat btana plz).

           Just Remember Future Pookie ke mindset se sochna.
           and at last I wanna say if you answer is NO toh bhi we will be bestfriends  and I will always be there for you. But will never quit impressing you.
           But sochke Answer dena cause I <h5>Hope</h5> That you will Say Yes. Meri glti ni hai meri gndi aadat hai ki mai humesha positive outcomes pe hi focus krta hu.
